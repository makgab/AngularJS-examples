# AngularJS Extends HTML

  - AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.

  - The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

  - The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

  - The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.

  - AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:

    ```
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
    ```
